Phoneword is a simple .NET MAUI application that converts words into numeric phone numbers—like turning “CALLME” into “225563”. It’s a lightweight, cross-platform app built with XAML and C#.

This app was created as part of my .NET Train Project, a personal learning initiative where I explored different technologies and frameworks in the .NET ecosystem.
